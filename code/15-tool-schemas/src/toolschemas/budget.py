"""Tools-as-token-budget calculator.

Every tool you expose is spent from the same context window as the user's data
(Post 15). Its JSON schema — name, description, and every parameter description —
is rendered into the prompt on every call. This module estimates that cost so you
can see what a fat catalogue actually buys, and what trimming it saves.

Token counts are ESTIMATED with a simple bytes/token heuristic so the module runs
offline with no tokenizer dependency. For real numbers, count with the provider's
tokenizer (Post 04); the *relative* comparison this module makes — is catalogue A
cheaper than catalogue B — is what matters for the design decision, and that holds.
