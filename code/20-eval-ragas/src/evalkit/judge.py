"""LLM-as-judge scaffold (online, guarded).

The judge scores things the deterministic metrics cannot — faithfulness (is every
claim supported by the retrieved context?) and answer relevancy. It is powerful and
biased: judges favour the FIRST option (position bias), LONGER answers (verbosity
bias), and their OWN family's outputs (self-preference). Mitigations are baked into
the prompt and comments below (Post 20).

The SDK is imported lazily; nothing here runs — or is needed — for the offline tests.
