"""evalkit — a small, honest evaluation harness for RAG.

Companion code for Post 20 (Evaluation). It mirrors the eval pyramid:

    Offline base (pure, unit-tested):
        metrics    — recall@k, answer_match
        goldenset  — load a JSON golden set and score a run against it
        gate       — the regression gate that blocks a deploy on a drop

    Online top (needs a key; imported lazily):
        judge      — LLM-as-judge for faithfulness, with bias mitigations noted

``ragas`` is the batteries-included alternative for the online metrics; this keeps
the core dependency-free so the whole gate runs in CI without a key.
