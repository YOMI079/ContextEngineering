"""Pure refund-eligibility logic — the business rules, with no MCP runtime.

Keeping the logic out of the server file is the point: the rules below are a plain
function you can unit-test offline, while ``server.py`` is a thin MCP wrapper around
them. This is the pattern Post 15 recommends — the protocol is a transport, not the
place your logic should live.
