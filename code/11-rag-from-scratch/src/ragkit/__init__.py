"""ragkit — a minimal, readable RAG pipeline in plain Python.

Companion code for Post 11 — RAG in depth.

The package is split into an OFFLINE core (pure functions, no network, no
optional dependencies) and an ONLINE adapter (guarded behind an env key):

    Offline core (import-safe, unit-tested):
        ingest  — read .md / .txt files off disk (with provenance)
        chunk   — sentence-aware chunking, ~400-600 tokens, 10-20% overlap
        bm25    — pure-Python lexical index (Okapi BM25)
        fuse    — Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) of ranked lists
        pack    — bookend context packing (lost-in-the-middle mitigation)

    Online adapter (needs an API key; imported lazily inside the function):
        generate — grounded answer with citations via the Anthropic SDK

Nothing in the offline core imports an SDK, so ``import ragkit`` never fails
because a provider package or key is missing.
