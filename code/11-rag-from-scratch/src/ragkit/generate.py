"""Grounded generation with citations (online adapter, guarded).

This is the only part of ragkit that calls a provider. The SDK is imported lazily
*inside* the function, and the function raises a clear error if the key is missing,
so importing ``ragkit`` never requires the SDK or a key. The offline core
(chunk / bm25 / fuse / pack) does all the interesting retrieval work; this just
stuffs the packed context into a prompt and asks the model to answer from it.
