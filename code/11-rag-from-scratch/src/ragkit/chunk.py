"""Sentence-aware chunking with overlap.

A chunk is a window of consecutive sentences whose combined length is close to a
target token count, with a few sentences of overlap carried into the next chunk.
Token counts here are approximated by whitespace-delimited words — good enough to
teach the shape; a production pipeline would count real model tokens (see
``ragkit.tokens``-style helpers in the post). The approximation is documented so
the numbers in the tests are reproducible offline with no dependencies.
