"""Read a corpus off disk, keeping provenance.

Real corpora are rarely clean plain text — Post 10 (Data ingestion and document
pipelines) is the upstream half of this story (parsing PDFs, HTML, tables, OCR).
This module deliberately reads only .md/.txt so the RAG core stays the focus; each
document keeps its source path so retrieved chunks can be cited.
