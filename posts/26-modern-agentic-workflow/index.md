# 26 · The modern agentic workflow

> **TL;DR.** A whole generation of coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue, Codex CLI, Cline, Replit Agent) converged on the same operating model: a long-running agent inside the editor or terminal, with file-system tools, repository-aware system prompts, sub-agent orchestration, and per-project skills. Understanding the *shape* of this workflow is now a context-engineering literacy. This post is the practitioner's tour: how the loop works, what `AGENTS.md` and skills actually do for you, and the patterns that make sessions productive.

## 1. What changed

For most of 2023 the standard "AI in the editor" pattern was *autocomplete plus inline chat*: Copilot suggested the next few lines; the user occasionally opened a side panel and asked a question. The model had no persistent context, no tools, no memory of the project.

The current generation is structurally different. The agent **lives in the project**, **reads files itself**, **edits files itself**, **runs commands itself** (with confirmation), **plans across many turns**, and **delegates sub-tasks to other agent instances**. The user moves from *prompting on every line* to *briefing on every task*.

The shift is large enough that the team-level practice changes too. The artefacts the project carries (`AGENTS.md`, skills, prompts, hooks) become first-class citizens of the codebase. The discipline of context engineering moves into the repository.

This post is deliberately vendor-neutral: the file names and menu items differ between hosts (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, and the rest), but the underlying model, the loop and the four context-engineering levers, is the same everywhere. Where a concrete example helps, the examples use the conventions that have converged across vendors rather than any single tool's exact syntax; consult your host's own docs for the precise flags.

## 2. The agent loop

Reduced to its simplest form, every modern coding agent runs the same loop.

```
load context (AGENTS.md, file tree, skills)
↓
plan task (decompose if needed, sometimes via a sub-agent)
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  while not done:                        │
│    think (LLM call)                     │
│    decide on next tool call             │
│    execute tool (read, write, run, …)   │
│    observe result                       │
│    update plan / scratchpad             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
summarise + commit / hand back to user
```

Each iteration is one LLM call plus one (or zero) tool call. A typical task takes 5–50 iterations; a complex one can take hundreds. The cost and latency of the loop are dominated by the *iteration count* and the *prompt size at each iteration*, which makes context engineering, again, the lever.

The four context-engineering decisions that shape the loop:

1. **What goes in the system prompt** → set by `AGENTS.md` plus the host's own preamble.
2. **What goes in the tool catalogue** → set by the host (file tools, shell tool, MCP servers, custom tools). MCP is the Model Context Protocol, the standard way hosts plug external tool servers into the agent ([Post 15](../15-tools-and-mcp/index.md)).
3. **How the conversation is compressed as it grows** → set by the host's auto-compaction policy plus per-project hooks.
4. **What sub-agents the planner can delegate to** → set by the host's skill / sub-agent configuration.

A team that consciously sets all four ships materially better sessions than a team that takes the defaults.

## 3. `AGENTS.md` (and `CLAUDE.md`)

The repository's per-project system prompt. Every reachable agent in the project loads it. The format is convention; the convention has converged across vendors. The two file names are the same idea from two lineages: `CLAUDE.md` is Claude Code's original name, `AGENTS.md` is the vendor-neutral name most other hosts adopted; a host typically reads whichever it finds (and some read both). Treat them as interchangeable and pick one per repository; the rest of this section says `AGENTS.md` throughout.

A working skeleton (the same five-block structure as [Post 14](../14-system-prompt-as-software/index.md), §2):

```markdown
# Project: Acme API

## Identity
A Python 3.12 + FastAPI backend for Acme's customer API. SQLAlchemy
2.x against Postgres 16. Tests with pytest + pytest-asyncio.

## Rules
- Every public function has a type annotation.
- Every change with behavioural impact has a test in `tests/`.
- Never commit to `main` directly; open a PR.
- Never edit files in `vendor/` or `legacy/`.
- Use `ruff` for formatting; the CI will reject other formatters.

## Format
- PR titles use Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, refactor, …).
- Commit bodies wrap at 72 columns.
- Code uses `from __future__ import annotations`; `from typing import …`.

## Knowledge
- Build: `make build`.
- Test: `make test` (uses Docker for the Postgres dependency).
- Deploy: `make deploy` (requires `STAGING=true` for non-prod).
- The `users` and `orders` tables are joined on `users.id = orders.user_id`.

## Tools
- `make migrate`: generate and apply Alembic migrations.
- `mcp:postgres`: read-only SQL against the local dev DB.
- `slash:run-tests`: runs `make test` and surfaces failing test names.
```

Subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files override or add to the parent. A `frontend/AGENTS.md` with TypeScript rules wins inside the frontend tree. The deepest matching file is the effective prompt for any operation in that subtree.

The discipline that makes this useful: **iterate from minimal**. Start with a near-empty file. Add a rule when a real failure motivates it (the agent removed a critical file; the agent renamed your enums; the agent committed in a style that broke CI). Speculative rules accumulate and contradict.

---

## 4. Skills

A **skill** is a small Markdown file (often called `skill.md`) that packages a single capability: a workflow the agent can invoke when the situation calls for it. A typical skill describes one task: how to draft a PR description in the team's style; how to write a Postgres migration; how to triage a production alert.

Each skill has the same five-block shape as a system prompt, but scoped to one concern. The host loads it *only when relevant*. A skill catalogue is essentially a small library of well-engineered procedural memories ([Post 16](../16-memory-systems/index.md), §4): searchable by name, retrievable on intent, and version-controlled like code.

**Where a skill lives, and how the host finds it.** A skill is a file on disk under a conventional directory (for example `.claude/skills/write-migration/skill.md` for a project-local skill, or a global directory in your home folder for skills you want in every project). A minimal one looks like this:

```markdown
---
name: write-migration
description: Draft an Alembic migration for a schema change on the Acme DB.
trigger: schema change, new column, new table, alter table, migration
---

## When to use
The user asks to change a database table or model.

## Steps
1. Read the current model in `app/models/`.
2. Generate the migration with `make migrate`.
3. Check the generated file edits only the intended tables.

## Example
Before: add a `deleted_at` column to `orders`.
After: a migration that adds the nullable column and a matching index.
```

The resolution rule has two parts. **Scope:** when a project-local skill and a global skill share a name, the project-local one wins, the same deepest-match override as subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files. **Relevance:** the host decides a skill is applicable by matching the current task against the skill's `name`, `description`, and `trigger` keywords, then loads that skill's body into context only for the turns where it applies. A skill you never trigger costs nothing; a skill with a vague description triggers at the wrong time. Write the `description` for the matcher, not for a human reader.

Two patterns make skill libraries pay off:

- **One concern per skill.** Like a Unix command. `write-migration.md` is a skill. `do-everything.md` is not.
- **Examples beat instructions.** A skill with two before/after examples is more useful than a skill with five paragraphs of rules. The agent learns from the shape.

The skill marketplaces (Anthropic's Agent Skills, third-party MCP directories, community skill repos) are early but growing. The *discipline* of writing your own skills is more valuable than the catalogue size; every team accumulates a small library specific to its codebase that no public skill could match. Skill mechanics are covered in more depth in [Post 15](../15-tools-and-mcp/index.md).

## 5. Sub-agents and the orchestrator pattern

Modern hosts let the main agent spawn sub-agents for scoped tasks. The patterns the field has converged on ([Post 13](../13-isolate-strategies/index.md), §2 and §4):

- **Research sub-agent.** "Read these three files and tell me how `process_order` is wired." The sub-agent does the reads; the parent gets a summary and keeps its context clean.
- **Test-and-fix sub-agent.** "Run the failing test, find the root cause, propose a fix." The sub-agent has shell + file tools; the parent stays at the planning level.
- **Migration sub-agent.** "Generate the Alembic migration for this schema change." The sub-agent has migration tools; the parent does not need to know the details.

Two tactical points:

- **Set the budget.** Each sub-agent has a maximum number of tool calls. Without this, a stuck sub-agent burns the day's tokens.
- **Make the contract explicit.** The sub-agent returns a structured summary (problem found, fix applied, tests passing). Free-form prose loses across the boundary.

A useful organisational habit: **review sub-agent transcripts on a sample**. The summaries the parent received can hide problems (the sub-agent skipped a test, hard-coded a value, edited a file it should not have). Periodic spot-checks keep the trust calibrated.

End to end, the orchestrator pattern is a four-step handshake. The parent (1) frames a scoped task and names the contract it expects back; (2) spawns the sub-agent with a fresh, minimal context and a tool budget; the sub-agent (3) does its own read-think-act loop in isolation and returns the agreed structured summary; the parent (4) folds only that summary back into its own context and continues planning. The point is the isolation: the parent never sees the sub-agent's forty intermediate tool calls, so its window stays small and on-task.

**The steelman against all this.** Cognition's "Don't Build Multi-Agents" (Cognition, 2025) argues the opposite case, and it is worth taking seriously. Sub-agents fragment context: decisions made in one sub-agent are invisible to another, so parallel sub-agents can make locally sensible but globally contradictory edits, and the reconciliation cost can exceed the isolation benefit. Their prescription is a single agent with a long, well-compacted context for anything that needs coherent decisions, and sub-agents reserved for genuinely independent, read-mostly work (the research pattern above). The rule of thumb that reconciles the two views: delegate work you could hand to a contractor with a one-paragraph brief and check by its output alone; keep in the main agent anything where the reasoning has to stay coherent. The full argument and counter-argument are worked through in [Post 13](../13-isolate-strategies/index.md), §9.

---

## 6. Hooks

Most modern hosts allow **hooks**: scripts that run at specific points in the agent loop. The pattern is borrowed from git hooks (scripts git runs automatically before a commit, after a checkout, and so on) and is roughly as useful: a small script fires on an event and can inspect, modify, or block what happens next.

A concrete one first, so the mechanism is not abstract. A post-edit hook that runs the linter and surfaces any failure back to the agent:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .claude/hooks/post-edit.sh — fires after the agent edits a file.
# $1 is the path the agent just wrote.
if ! ruff check "$1"; then
  echo "ruff failed on $1; fix the reported issues before continuing." >&2
  exit 1   # non-zero: the host surfaces this back to the agent as a tool error
fi
```

The agent edits a file, the hook runs `ruff`, and if the file is malformed the failure lands back in the agent's context on the next turn, so it self-corrects without the user intervening. That is the whole idea; the rest is choosing good points to attach to.

Common hook points and what teams use them for:

- **Pre-tool-call.** Validate the tool args; reject dangerous combinations (e.g., a `delete` on a path outside the project).
- **Post-tool-call.** Format the output; clip noisy logs down to what matters; record a structured trace span.
- **Pre-edit.** Check the target file is not in a generated/vendored directory.
- **Post-edit.** Run the formatter; run the relevant test; if either fails, surface back to the agent.
- **Pre-commit.** Run linter / typecheck; block if either fails.
- **Session-start.** Print a one-line reminder of the day's task; load the project status; pin a "today's goal" cell into memory.
- **Session-end.** Compress the conversation; write a summary to a daily journal; archive the trace.

Hooks are how a team encodes its culture into the agent without bloating the system prompt. They are also where security controls ([Post 23](../23-security/index.md)) actually enforce: *do not let the agent overwrite production config* is a hook, not a rule in `AGENTS.md`.

## 7. The four workflow anti-patterns

Each of these turns a productive session into an expensive one.

**Anti-pattern 1: letting context grow without compaction.** The session has been running for four hours. The conversation is, say, 180k tokens (illustrative). Every new turn pays for all of it. The agent's quality has been silently degrading for the last hour because of distraction ([Post 06](../06-context-failure-modes/index.md), §2) and lost-in-the-middle ([Post 03](../03-how-llms-read-context/index.md), §4). The fix is hosted auto-compaction with sensible thresholds and the discipline of `/compact` (or equivalent) when the user notices quality drift.

**Anti-pattern 2: over-broad task framing.** "Refactor the codebase" is not a task; it is a research project. The agent will burn the budget exploring. The fix is to break the work into 30-minute scoped tasks with clear definition of done. The agent works best at the same scope a human contributor does in a focused hour.

**Anti-pattern 3: letting the agent autonomously edit everything.** Confirmation prompts feel like friction; they catch a lot. Tools that can do destructive things (delete files, force-push, drop database tables, run `rm -rf`) need confirmation in the host, not just in the prompt. The fix is the security defences from [Post 23](../23-security/index.md), applied locally to the dev environment.

**Anti-pattern 4: no skills, no hooks, default `AGENTS.md`.** The team is using the agent on hard mode. Every session starts cold; the same instructions are typed for the dozenth time; the same defaults trip the agent up. The fix is investing one hour to set up the project-level customisations; it pays back within the first week.

---

## 8. The session as a unit of work

A useful mental model: **treat each agent session like a focused human-collaborator session**. Brief on the goal. Give it the relevant context. Check in at meaningful boundaries. Review the diff. Pair on the hard parts.

The teams getting the most leverage from these tools are the ones that have moved decisively from "the agent autocompletes my code" to "the agent does scoped tasks I assign and review". The shift is cultural as much as technical, and it is the largest practical productivity change the tools deliver.

---

## Common pitfalls

- **No `AGENTS.md`.** Every session re-discovers the project conventions.
- **Bloated `AGENTS.md`.** Every call pays for it; humans stop reading it; rules contradict.
- **No auto-compaction policy.** The session degrades silently after a few hours.
- **Sub-agents without budget caps.** A stuck sub-agent burns the day's tokens.
- **No hooks for dangerous commands.** Eventually the agent runs the wrong destructive command.
- **Treating agents as autocomplete.** The leverage of the new tools comes from delegating tasks, not from typing assistance.
